            <h2>About Birds</h2>
            <p>There are so many types of birds. Most birds can fly but not all of them can. For example, a chicken is a bird but it cannot fly (at least I have never seen one fly).</p>
            <p>Here is what Wikipedia has to say about birds ...</p>
            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird">
              Birds (Aves) are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds. Birds are the closest living relatives of crocodilians. Birds are descendants of extinct dinosaurs with feathers, making them the only surviving dinosaurs according to cladistics.
