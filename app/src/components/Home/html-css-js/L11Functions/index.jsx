        <h1>What is a function?</h1>
        <p>A function is a grouping of reusable code. For example: Say you needed to do a bunch things many times in your application such as</p>
        <OL
          listItems={[
            'Create a file',
            'Open the file',
            'Write text to the file',
            'Print the file',
          ]}
        />
        <p>Doing that in pseudo code would look lik this</p>
        <Pre
          code={[
            'file.create someFile.txt',
            'let f = file.open someFile.txt',
            'f.writeText = "this is the text for my file"',
            'f.print',
          ]}
          language='js'
        />
        <p>The above performed 4 operations on a file named 'someFile.txt'. Now you need to do it again to a different file with diffent text</p>
        <Pre
          code={[
            'file.create differentFile.txt',
            'let f = file.open differentFile.txt',
            'f.writeText = "put some different text in the different file"',
            'f.print',
          ]}
          language='js'
        />
        <p>There are real-life software applications that perform these actions on 1000s of files. Could you imagin writing those 4 lines of code 1000s of times? Clearly the answer is 'no' and fortunately there is a solution - functions!</p>
        {/* <p>Further, the software doesn't know the name of the file nor what text to put in the file until it is told. Wouldn't it be nice if there were a way to reuse the same lines of code? There is! It is called <b>functions</b></p> */}

        <p>Here is an example of a real JavaScript function that prints hello to the page</p>
