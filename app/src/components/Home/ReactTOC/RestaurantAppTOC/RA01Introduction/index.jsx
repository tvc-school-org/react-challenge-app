        <P>Welcome to the React Restaurant Website Challenge! In this challenge you will build a website for a restaurant named 'Wholesome Foods' which does its best to appeal to health conscious clients while serving a mix of healthy but sometimes cholesterol ridden dishes.</P>
        <P>This is a challenge, not a tutorial and as such, instructions are left intentionally vague to encourage the use of problem solving skills. Your best source of information for solving the challenge is <A href='https://reactjs.org/'>Facebook's React site</A>.</P>
        <Callout goal>
          <P>If you are interested in learning about the concepts in this challenge in more depth as well as more advanced React concepts &amp; techniques, make sure you are a member of our Meetup group <A href='https://www.meetup.com/trivalleycoders/'>TriValley Coders</A> to receive notification of upcoming classes.</P>

          <P>This challenge is designed for those new to ReactJS. If you know some HTML, CSS and have a good grasp of JavaScript, you are ready to proceed.</P>

        <Section title='What will you build' level={2}>
          <P>You will build a typical restaurant website. It will have a header, gallery of dishes with pictures and a menu that can be updated.</P>
          <P>The site is first built as a static page (i.e., read only) and then you are challenged to add interactivity of increasing complexity. The official ReactJS documentation recommends building a React site statically first and then adding live data and interactivity. However, if you are an experienced React developer then chart your own course.</P>

          <P>Don't spend much time on styling. If your components work you have succeeded even if they don't look good.</P>
