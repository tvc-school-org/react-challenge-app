      <Section title='A Note on Hardware and OS' level={1}>
        <P>I always recommend getting the best hardware you can afford and think it is better to buy a used machine than an under-powered new one. Since I only know the hardware I own I don't really know what the minimum hardware requirement is. However, I highly suggest a minimum of a dual-core i5 or better processor and at least 4 gigs of RAM. The machine I use in class is a quad-core i5 with 8 GB of RAM and is up to pretty much anything I need to do.</P>
        <P>Linux, Mac and Windows are all good for class and we have experience using Windows, Mac & Ubuntu.</P>
        <P>The best way to know if your machine is up to the task is to follow the install instructions below and see if your machine is adequately responsive while using Atom.</P>

        <Section title='NodeJS & npm' level={2}>
          <P>npm is a package manager for NodeJS packages. Some people say 'npm' stands for 'node package manager', but I have also read it doesn't. npm comes with NodeJS, so install Node on your machine and npm will be ready to go.</P>
          <P>Node offers a LTS (long-term support) and 'Current' version. Be sure to install the LTS version.</P>
          <P>You can find Node at
            <A href='https://nodejs.org'>NodeJS</A>. Links to OS specific installations are below.</P>

          <Section title='Atom Packages' level={3}>
            <P>Atom also has packages to add functionality. Without these added packages Atom is a very basic text editor, but with them it becomes very powerful. You can add packages via the Atom UI or via the 'atom package manager' (apm). We will do the latter.</P>
            <P>On an older or low powered machine Atom will get slow if you add too many packages. Below are 3 levels of packages. Only the first level is really needed. Add the second level if you think you machine is up to it. The third level you can install what is of interest to you.</P>
